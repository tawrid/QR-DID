# This script is a conceptual demonstration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
# principles. In a real-world scenario, you would use a specialized PQC library
# like 'pysodium' with quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., Kyber, Dilithium).
# For this demonstration, we use the standard 'cryptography' library to
# simulate the process of key generation and digital signing, which are core
# to PQC.

# A crucial note for a real PQC implementation:
# The following code uses standard ECC and RSA for illustration.
# To be truly quantum-resilient, these would be replaced with
# algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber (for key exchange) and CRYSTALS-Dilithium
# (for digital signatures) as standardized by NIST.
